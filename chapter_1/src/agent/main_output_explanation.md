# Main Output Explanation

This file explains the behavior observed when running the main application file (`main.py`).

## Code Example

In `main.py`, the following code is executed to generate text:

```
output = client.text_generation(
    "The capital of France is",
    max_new_tokens=100,
)
```

This snippet sends the prompt "The capital of France is" to the model after initializing the InferenceClient with the HF token loaded from the .env file.

## Expected Behavior and Output

When you run `main.py`:

- The script loads environment variables using python-dotenv.
- It initializes the Hugging Face InferenceClient with your HF token and the model "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct".
- The client sends the prompt "The capital of France is" to the model.
- The model generates a continuation of the text. Typically, the output starts with "Paris" and may continue with additional tokens that list other country-capitals, up to the specified maximum tokens.

This output demonstrates how the language model uses learned patterns to predict and complete the provided prompt.

## Additional Context

- The `max_new_tokens` parameter limits how many new tokens the model can generate, which directly affects the length of the output.
- This example shows the behavior of a simple prompt, which might lead to longer and more varied outputs compared to a prompt structured with special tokens.
- Understanding this helps in designing prompts that get the desired response, whether you want a concise answer or a more extended output.
