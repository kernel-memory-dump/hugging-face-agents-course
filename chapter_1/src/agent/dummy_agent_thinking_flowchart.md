# Agent Thinking and Tool Calling Flow Chart

This flowchart illustrates the internal reasoning process of the agent when it processes a query and performs a tool call. It represents the chain-of-thought and the decision-making process in a simplified way.

    A[Receive User Query] --> B[Parse System Prompt and Instructions]
    B --> C[Generate Initial Thoughts]
    C --> D[Decide: Is a tool action required?]
    D -- Yes --> E[Construct JSON for Tool Calling]
    E --> F[Call Tool (e.g., get_weather)]
    F --> G[Receive Observation from Tool]
    G --> H[Integrate Observation into Reasoning]
    H --> I[Refine Answer through Further Thought]
    I --> J[Final Answer: Conclude and Respond]
    D -- No --> K[Generate Direct Response]
    K --> J
```

The flowchart shows that after the agent receives a query, it parses the system prompt and instructions, then generates initial thoughts. It then decides whether a tool action is needed. If so, it constructs the appropriate JSON, calls the tool, and integrates the observation from that tool into its reasoning process. Finally, the agent refines its answer and responds. If no tool call is needed, the agent directly generates a response.
