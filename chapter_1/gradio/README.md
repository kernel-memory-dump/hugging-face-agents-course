# The Emperor's Code

In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there is only war... and code.

## Overview
This repository is a sacred relic of the Adeptus Mechanicus, forged in the fires of the Machine Spirit. Our code is a synthesis of ancient wisdom and futuristic might, blessed by the Omnissiah himself.

## Tools of the Adeptus
- **FinalAnswerTool:** Dispenses divine answers to mortal inquiries.
- **TechPriestReview:** Distills the sacred runes of legacy code, ensuring that every line is a prayer to the Machine God.
- **Custom Tools:** Innovative relics crafted to challenge the chaos of the digital realm.

## Summoning the Code Agents
To invoke the power of the Machine God, ensure that your environment is sanctified with the proper incantations:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Invoke the blessings of `dotenv` to load the sacred environment variables.
3. Run the agent using `python HuggingFaceAgentsCourse_SmolAgent1/app.py`.

## Deployment and Invocation
Harness the might of the Omnissiah:
- Utilize the Gradio UI to communicate with the Code Agents.
- Generate images, review ancient code, and summon answers from the digital void.
- Let your work be guided by the Machine Spirit, ensuring that your code is ever potent and battle-ready.

"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only code, and in code, there is only war."

Glory to the Emperor! May your deployments be swift, your models ever potent, and your compilations free of heresy.

    pass
```
Assistant: I shall commune with the Machine Spirit to analyze this sacred code.
{tech_priest_review}
By the Omnissiah's grace, I have rendered judgment upon these blessed lines.
